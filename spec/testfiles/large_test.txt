The purpose of this study is to aid the further growth of these heretofore-independent streams of research by developing a comparative framework that allows us to distinguish between them. Drawing on the theories of automaticity and incentive-sensitization, we developed a theoretical model that describes the nature, antecedents, and consequences of habitual and addictive IT use in the context of social networking services. The proposed model was tested based on the longitudinal data collected from 420 actual users of Twitter. We found that the habitual use was indeed influenced by its proposed unique antecedents of routine seeking and cognitive rigidity, whereas addictive use was not. Similarly, addictive use was influenced by its proposed unique antecedents of focused immersion and concern for social acceptance, whereas habitual use was not. Looking at their outcomes, we found that although both drivers positively affected goal-congruent outcomes, only habitual use enhanced goal-congruent usage while addictive use had a negative impact. Overall, this study contributes to the IS literature by offering a robust conceptual framework that allows us to observe the profound differences between these superficially similar drivers of routine IT use.Keywords: online user behavior, SNS use, habit, addiction, longitudinal study, structural equation modeling	 1.	IntroductionIn recent years many online services have become integral elements of our lifestyle that we constantly reach for throughout the day. An exemplary case is seen in the phenomenal rise of social networking sites, or SNS, with almost a third of Facebook users and a fifth of Twitter users returning to their SNS several times a day (Thadani and Cheung 2011, Hampton et al. 2011). In terms of time spent on SNS, 17.3% of users spend more than 10 hours per week on their preferred service, and 3.3% spend as many as 25 hours a week (Salaway et al. 2008). Information systems (IS) researchers have recognized that frequent use of IT is often habitual, and involves markedly different psychological states and behavioral consequences than what occurs with merely continued use over time (deGuinea and Markus 2009, Kim 2009, Kim et al. 2005, Limayem et al. 2007, Polites and Karahanna 2012). But for some users, online services such as SNS might be more an addiction than a habit. Addictive use of SNS can have negative effects on work and social relationships, and it is even associated with criminal behaviors such as cyberstalking and unlawful surveillance (Phillips 2009, Tokunaga 2011).The IS discipline has already shown keen interest in both the habitual and addictive use of IT applications. In particular, Kim et al. (2005) found that prior use of certain online services is a strong predictor of future use, and thus indicative of habitual tendencies. Limayem et al. (2007) similarly showed that past use strengthens habitual use, which eventually drives continued use at the postadoption stage. In addition, Polites and Karahanna (2012) demonstrated that habitual behavior tends to prevent information technology (IT) users from adopting other applications. Several pioneering works related to IT addiction have also recently emerged (Turel et al. 2011a, Turel et al. 2011b; Turel and Serenko 2012). These studies paint an unequivocal picture of the harmful effects of obsessive IT use driven by addiction. Looking at mobile e-mail use among workers, Turel et al. (2011a) found that addiction increases technology-family conflict and work overload. In a similar vein, Turel et al. (2011b) showed that addiction to online auctions distorts individuals’ beliefs of the perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment of IT.Although IT-specific research on habit and addiction have contributed immensely to our understanding of each of the two phenomena, recent developments in these two streams have remained largely independent and uninformed by each other (Polites and Karahanna 2012, Turel et al. 2011, Turel and Serenko 2012). As a result, our conceptualizations of habit and addiction have grown larger in scope and have begun to encroach on one another. For example, both habit and addiction are believed to primarily come about from frequent past use and enjoyment of IT applications, leaving us with little room to distinguish which course frequent users are likely to take. Furthermore, both streams believe might be an impulsive element to these driving forces, which makes it difficult to clearly distinguish the core nature of these phenomena. Similarly, prior research suggests that both habit and addiction result in even higher levels of IT use than before, without clearly demarcating the ramifications of such extensive usage in each case. These gaps in our understanding suggest a need to discern the subtle differences between habit and addiction in terms of their nature, antecedents, and consequences.Research that explicitly contrasts habit and addiction is in short supply. Until the theories that underlie these two phenomena are juxtaposed and compared, key questions about habit and addiction will remain unanswered. To this end, we developed a unified theoretical framework that contrasts habit and addiction in the context of SNS use. We decompose these two phenomena into their respective antecedent mental states, into corresponding patterns of habitual or addictive use, and how the outcome of each pattern of behavior relates to one’s goals. Drawing on the theory of automaticity, we propose that habitual use is the automatic activation of goal-directed behavior (Aarts and Dijksterhuis 2000, Bargh et al. 2001, Kim et al. 2005). Meanwhile, using the incentive-sensitization theory, we theorize that addictive use is obsessive and compulsive behavior that deviates from personal interests (Kelley and Berridge 2002, Robinson and Berridge 1993, Robinson and Berridge 2003). The model proposed in this study suggests that although past use is a common antecedent of habit and addiction, there are other differentiable antecedents between habit and addiction. We argue that the unique cognitive antecedents of habitual use, such as routine seeking and cognitive rigidity, have little impact on addictive use. In a similar vein, the antecedents of addictive use, such as focused immersion and concern for social acceptance, exert little influence on habitual use. In addition, our model holds that habitual use and addictive use of IT differ in their behavioral consequences. Specifically, we argue that the consequences of habitual use, but not necessarily those of addictive use, largely align with personal interests. We sought to verify our propositions through an empirical study in the context of SNS use because it is a powerful context in which behavior is likely driven by both habit and addiction. We tested the research model using longitudinal data collected from actual users of Twitter, which is one of the most popular SNS in the world (Lunden 2012).The findings of this longitudinal study are expected to contribute significantly to IS research in several ways: First, this study represents an initial attempt to develop a theoretical model of SNS use that simultaneously examines habitual use and addictive use and clarifies the unique properties of each. Second, we looked beyond past use, which is a well-known and common determinant of habit and addiction, to systematically compare several distinct antecedent mechanisms that past use alone cannot account for. Finally, this study is an early step in the examination of the different outcomes and consequences of habitual use and addictive use. Overall, our theory-driven analysis of habit and addiction offers a new and useful conceptual framework for understanding habit and addiction in the context of SNS use. As the investigation into these related but subtly different constructs deepens, IS researchers and IT managers will be better able to steer the design and management of online services in a direction that maximizes repatronage without encouraging harmful directions.2. Habit versus AddictionUsers of SNS read and post messages to socialize with others. The conscious, repeated use of IT services like SNS often becomes an automatic and habitual action (Jasperson et al. 2005, Kim et al. 2005, Limayem et al. 2007). This perspective of habitual automaticity is rooted in cognitive psychology (Aarts and Dijksterhuis 2000, Verplanken et al. 1998) and has been adopted in IS literature (e.g., Venkatesh and Davis 2000, Venkatesh et al. 2003). Researchers believe that users initially evaluate IT based on conscious deliberations about its pros and cons and that they purposefully coordinate their use of such IT toward desired goals. However, the links that bind a goal and its corresponding actions become mentally hardwired with repetition. As a result, the routine use of IT can eventually become habitual in that it is automatically triggered, without deliberation, whenever an intended goals needs to be achieved (Bargh et al. 2001, Jasperson et al. 2005, Kim et al. 2005). Habitually using SNS can be helpful to users because they expend little cognitive effort to activate participatory behaviors that help them meet their personal and social goals and also because this habit can be discarded when no longer useful.However, some users find that their relationship with an IT application has spiraled into addictive use (Robinson and Berridge 2003, Turel et al. 2011b). Neuroscience uses the theory of incentive-sensitization to address the process by which initially benign behavior turns compulsive (Robinson and Berridge 1993). According to this theory, repeated exposure to highly pleasurable stimuli can hypersensitize neural systems and thereby amplify ¬the pleasure associated with rewarding behavior. Hypersensitization subsequently leads to incentive salience, wherein addicts feel compelled to pursue behaviors that are registered in memory as previously having triggered pleasure (Kelley and Berridge 2002). Incentive salience is essential to addiction because it activates the change from “liking” to “wanting” (Robinson and Berridge 1993). Susceptible individuals may keep repeating behaviors that were once rewarding even after their outcome is no longer as gratifying as before (Ainslie 2001). In SNS use, repeated visits can make the neural systems of certain users increasingly sensitive to the pleasure of social participation. But as these users immerse themselves in such interactions, they may become increasingly concerned about the possibility of being denied or derided by others (Caplan 2002). In the end, addicted users may come to the point where they are obsessed with using their SNS despite the failure of this excessive usage to continue meeting their needs (Grodner and Reid 2010).From the fundamental theories underlying habitual use and addictive use, we can intuit that these behaviors involve deeply different processes, beginning with different antecedent mental states and resulting in considerably different outcomes on people’s lives. But distinguishing these two types of behavior from empirical studies in the literature proves difficult. As described earlier, both mediators are thought to immediately stem from similar factors and produce similar short-term results. This study is deigned to identify the antecedents that have distinctly different effects on habit than they do on addiction. And we also attempt to examine how the outcomes of habitual use and addictive use vary in their alignment with users’ initial goals. In these ways, we will be able to slowly tease apart the otherwise intractably related phenomena of habitual and addictive use of IT.3. Research HypothesesFigure 1 shows an overall conceptual model of the relationships we proposed in this study. By contrasting the habitual and addictive use of information technologies, we found that habit and addiction each have unique causes and unique consequences in the context of SNS use. Their potentially common antecedents are listed as control variables. Appendix A summarizes the relevant literature on habit and addiction in terms of several criteria, including study contexts, methodologies, research variables, and findings.3.1. Habitual UseHabit is an automatic process that begins with an initially deliberate behavior that is repeatedly performed to accomplish a goal. Eventually, subjects automatically perform the needed behavior when the outcome of the goal is again desired (Verplanken and Orbell 2003). Among users of information systems, this habit process usually yields a relatively stable long-term pattern of frequent use (Kim et al. 2005). The part of the habit process we are particularly interested in is habitual use, which occurs when habit has formed and behavior is automatically activated without deliberation or planning. Because habitual use is essentially goal-oriented behavior, habitual users can retrospectively check whether its outcome fulfills the initial goal (Kim et al. 2005, Limayem et al. 2007). Inconsistencies between the outcome of habitual actions and one’s initial goals can trigger the need for a conscious reevaluation (Polites and Karahanna 2012). In such a case, habit dissolves and cognitive power again takes charge to seek a new solution to the changing environment (Louis and Sutton 1991). Thus, vigilant users can break their habit by deliberately adopting a new sequence of actions (Verplanken and Wood 2006). Some people are more likely to be vigilant than others with regard to the value of their habitual service vis-à-vis alternative services. These watchful individuals are likely to perform retrospective appraisals more frequently, actions that would create more opportunities for them to reevaluate the consequences of habitual use. If done to excess, such retrospection can even hinder the formation of habitual behavior. However, the lack of constant retrospection—attributed to such personal characteristics as routine seeking and cognitive rigidity—is extremely conducive to the formation of habitual use (Polites and Karahanna 2012).Routine seeking refers to “an individual’s tendency to incorporate routines into their life, and a preference for familiar situations with limited stimulation and novelty” (Polites and Karahanna 2012, p. 30). People who tend to seek routines are less likely to retrospectively check whether the outcome of a routine aligns with their goal. Such people will seek to avoid new situations that might result in changes (Harrison 1968, Harrison and Zajonc 1970). As a result, routine seeking leads one to follow familiar rituals, which is conducive to the further development of habitual tendencies. Thus, we posit that a personal trait of routine seeking will have a positive relationship with habitual use of SNS.H1: Routine seeking will have a positive relationship with habitual use of SNS.Cognitive rigidity refers to a personal trait of being reluctant to change one’s mind (Rokeach 1960). People inclined toward cognitive rigidity are characterized as dogmatic, closed-minded, and less willing and able to adjust to new situations (Oreg 2003). Cognitive rigidity is negatively related to the capability to learn new approaches; that is, once those with a high degree of cognitive rigidity adopt a certain course of action, they stay with it without considering alternatives (Corder and Corder 1974). These users are less likely to rely on careful deliberation to examine whether the outcome of SNS use coincides with an initial goal. Therefore, cognitive rigidity should reinforce habitual use.H2: Cognitive rigidity will have a positive relationship with habitual use of SNS.Although we assert that one’s propensity to resist changes affects habitual use, we do not believe that it would drive addictive use. Unlike the goal-oriented nature of habit, addiction is generally contrary to a person’s own interests. Although SNS users have the opportunity to assess post-use experiences, our research suggests that those who are addiction-prone tend to justify their irrational choices by distorting their perceptions (Davis 2001, Sutton 1987, Turel et al. 2011b). Thus, the automaticity perspective is irrelevant to the gradual spiral into addictive use.3.2. Addictive UseThe literature on addiction suggests that it also is a process — one that grows through two distinct opposing forces that push people into actively performing a behavior out of obsession, rather than letting them passively settle into a habit. These two forces are a deepening involvement in seeking rewards and a reactive concern about the possibility of losing such rewards (Gray 1970, Gray and McNaughton 2000, Kelley and Berridge 2002, Jennett et al. 2008). In contrast to habit, the addiction process initially stems from a distorted value system that overestimates the positive consequences of rewarding behaviors and eventually underestimates its negative consequences (Ainslie 2001). The addiction process is also unlike habit in that it is eventually reinforced by constant anxiety that one’s source of pleasure may end. In this study, the part of the addiction process we are most interested in is the actual experience of addictive use, in which users return to an SNS service out of a persistent obsession. We posit that those who overly immerse themselves in their SNS experience are deeply involved and more prone to addictive use than others. Likewise, we expect that those who are most anxious about losing the pleasurable benefits of SNS interactions are more vulnerable to addictive use than others (Gray 1970, Gray and McNaughton 2000). Together, focused immersion and concern for social acceptance deserve scrutiny because both are antecedent states of mind that bring about addictive use even into negative consequences.Early in the process of falling into addiction, people go through a hypersensitization process in which they achieve a higher state of excitement each time they return to a source of pleasure (Kelley and Berridge 2002). A heightened cognitive state experienced during the use of IT is referred to as focused immersion (Agarwal and Karahanna 2000). Focused immersion, which involves a heightened sensory experience that suppresses awareness of one’s surroundings and concerns, has proven to be a significant predictor of addiction in the context of IT use (Jennett et al. 2008, Seah and Cairns 2008). Focused immersion provides users with sensory experiences that enable them to temporarily forget their daily worries and concerns (Jennett et al. 2008). As people become more deeply engaged with an IT mediated task, they become less aware of their surroundings and the passage of time (Seah and Cairns 2008). This highly pleasurable sense of immersion is consistent with the pre-addiction phase within the incentive-sensitization framework. In particular, hypersensitization to SNS is likely to center on the perceived positive results of SNS use that create a time free of stress and everyday worries and concerns. The hypersensitization process ensures every immersion experience will deliver SNS users an even a higher level of pleasure than the last. Over time, the incentive to use SNS will be so strong that users will eventually be obsessed with the using SNS. Thus, incentive-sensitization theory suggests that users who experience the heightened state of focused immersion are susceptible to hypersensitization, which increases addictive use of SNS.	H3: Focused immersion will have a positive relationship with addictive use of SNS.SNS are considered to be online forums that help particpants to avoid the embarrassment possible in face-to-face relationships, while satisfying individuals’ craving for social interaction. SNS provides individuals with a safe and secure medium of social interaction. As a result, individuals who crave social interaction tend to be increasingly dependent on online relationships and easily fall victim to addiction (Morahan-Martin and Schumacher 2000, Caplan 2002, Davis et al. 2002). Such online users—who are in need of, anxious for, and concerned about social acceptance in the context of SNS—are likely to abuse the medium because it becomes a critical outlet that fills a social void and creates rewarding social experiences. We define concern for social acceptance as one’s worry about the lack of positive social contacts within the context of SNS use (Morahan-Martin and Schumacher 2000). This factor is derived from a more general notion of need-to-belong in social psychology (Mellor et al. 2008) and is adapted to be specific to social issues related to addictive use of SNS. People who are high on concern for social acceptance tend to seek online relationships. But, more important, they want such relationships to be warm, supportive, and pleasant. In particular, concern for social acceptance indicates anxiety over critical responses from other users of SNS for the fear of being left alone (Morahan-Martin and Schumacher 2000, Caplan 2002, Davis et al. 2002). And, this state of mental condition is known to be strongly associated with uncontrollable dependency on online relationships. In summary, the discussion mentioned previously leads us to expect that SNS users with concern social acceptance are likely to develop patterns of addictive use.H4: Concern for social acceptance will have a positive relationship with addictive use of SNS.We stated earlier that the retrospective appraisals that are made possible by routine seeking and cognitive rigidity should not significantly lead to addictive use because people stick to addictive behavior regardless of whether or not it aligns with their interests. Similarly, we find no reason to expect that the antecedents of addictive use, i.e., focused immersion and concern for social acceptance, will affect habitual use. Habit forms when mental links are strengthened with repeated use and its formation is not clearly linked to emotional states such as immersion or from deliberations about social acceptance.3.3. Habitual Use and Addictive UseSeveral studies have suggested that habitual use can lead to addictive use (Berke and Hyman 2000, Everitt and Robbins 2005, Grover et al. 2011). These studies indicate that the transition to addictive use shows a fundamental change in the brain from deliberate processing to spontaneous processing. Habitual use is one such type of spontaneous processing, and so it provides a possible foundation for the development of addictive use.  Although habitual use does not always lead into addictive use, it can facilitate addictive use.Take, for example, a person who initially visits a website to enjoy free time during a lunch break. He or she may soon regularly follow the same routine and, over time, these visits could become habitual. This type of habitual behavior is considered benign because it serves the intended purpose of relaxation before returning to work. However, in certain cases, such a user may become sensitized to the thrill of SNS use while overestimating the benefits and underestimating the costs of such usage. As this user becomes more experienced with the website, the incentive-salience process may set in and the user could become obsessed with checking and posting “what’s going on” within his or her personal sphere (Chak and Leung 2004; Chou and Ting 2003). Thus, habitual use can be a precursor to addiction because the incentive-sensitization process in the brain’s systems occurs gradually with the repetition of the same acts in the realm of spontaneous processing (Robinson and Berridge 1993, Robinson and Berridge 2003), rather than through deliberate immersion. What was once a casual routine behavior could be transformed into an addiction (Turel and Serenko 2012). Thus, we propose that all things being equal, habitual use increases the likelihood of addictive use.H5: Habitual use of SNS will have a positive relationship with addictive use of SNS.3.4. Goal-Congruent UsageWe have noted throughout that habitual use is a goal-directed behavior, but addictive use is not. To better discern habitual use from addictive use, we can examine how the outcomes of these two behaviors are aligned with, or deviate from, personal goals. To this end, the literature on goal-setting and striving suggests that plan enactment and goal realization are the final phases of goal-directed behavior (Bagozzi et al. 2003). Plan enactment is defined as “the degree of successful enactment of the chosen plan”, whereas goal realization refers to “the attainment of the goal chosen by the decision maker” (Bagozzi et al. 2003, p. 280). Plan enactment is a concept with a focus on whether the action plan is implemented as intended; in contrast, goal realization represents whether the outcome of the action meets the intended goal. Thus, we argue that habitual use and addictive use should have discernibly different impacts on plan enactment and goal realization specific to the online use of SNS.In this paper, we propose an IT-specific construct called goal-congruent usage, which is comparable to plan enactment. As one of the behavioral outcomes, goal-congruent usage measures the extent to which an amount of SNS usage is consistent with an individual’s original plan. We consider the level of SNS use to be highly goal congruent if it is contained within the limits of prior expectation, and we deem it to have low goal congruence if it exceeds prior expectations. In looking at the personal use of SNS, addictive use may do more harm than good to individual users, organizations, and society as a whole (Holden 2001, Hur 2006, Wang and Chu 2007, Young 2004). Thus, when studying potentially addictive SNS use, it is critical to understand to what extent the amount of SNS use is aligned with one’s rational interests.We expect that habitual use and addictive use result in strikingly different goal-congruent usage. Habitual use of SNS stems from personal goals, although the user may no longer be consciously aware of the association between goal and actions (Kim et al. 2005). Habitual use of SNS simply indicates that individuals’ visits to SNS are performed automatically so that precious mental energy can be allocated to different tasks. However, because of the goal-oriented nature of habitual use (Louis and Sutton 1991), a user who feels he or she is spending too much time on SNS can revert to conscious evaluation and deliberately break the chain of habit and reduce SNS usage to match earlier expectations. Thus, we hypothesize that habitual use of SNS is positively related with goal-congruent usage of SNS.H6: Habitual use of SNS will have a positive relationship with goal-congruent usage of SNS.Unlike habitual use, which is goal-driven, addictive use reflects a persistent dependency on SNS use. Incentive salience, which is the key process underlying addiction, changes brain systems to regularly produce insatiable urges for more of the pleasure they once found from SNS use. At this stage an individual’s behavior is no longer moderated by any rational reflection about one’s objectives. Instead, an addict has become the subject of his or her distorted mental state. As a result, we expect that addictive use yields excessive reading and posting of messages on SNS by users, beyond what they had earlier considered appropriate. Thus, without strong mechanisms to balance their addictive use, we predict that addicted users will find their actual usage has quickly exceeded their earlier expectations.H7: Addictive use of SNS will have a negative relationship with goal-congruent usage.3.5. Goal-Congruent OutcomePeople use SNSs for a variety of reasons, from getting up-to-date information to feeling connected with others (Hampton et al. 2011). It is reasonable to expect that some users will find they need to spend extra time on their SNS to achieve their desired outcome. In such cases, goal-congruent usage may not be enough to gauge whether SNS use is excessive. Thus, we further assert that users’ evaluations of their usage should also examine the congruence between initial motivations and perceived outcomes. In this study, goal-congruent outcome refers to the extent to which the consequence of using SNS is consistent with an one’s original plan. This factor is an IT-specific version of goal realization (Bagozzi et al. 2003), and it is quite comparable to such well-known concepts as perceived usefulness and relative advantage in the IS literature (Davis et al. 1989, Moore and Benbasat 1991). But goal-congruent outcome differs from those constructs in that it is specifically directed toward personal use of an IT application instead of work-related use within an organizational setting. Goal-congruent outcome could be low even when goal-congruent usage is high if the SNS use does not help achieve the personal goal. For some reasons (e.g., luck, misunderstanding), goal-congruent outcome could be high even though goal-congruent usage is low. Thus, as with plan enactment and goal realization, goal-congruent usage and outcome are clearly distinguishable.	We expect habitual use and addictive use to yield different evaluations of goal-congruent outcomes. We propose that habitual use has a positive relationship with a goal-congruent outcome. Individuals’ motivations will initially activate conscious use of SNS, but with repeated use, the mere presence of a cue can trigger automatic use. Although users may visit their SNS without any deliberate plans beforehand, such behavior is still expected to serve their original goals. From time to time, habitual users may find it undesirable to continue to use their current SNS. Habitual users are assumed to have full control over their behavior when its outcome differs from their goals (Gollwitzer 1996); consequently they can change their actions relatively easily to better align their SNS use with their original motivations. Thus, we hypothesize that the more habitual one’s SNS use is, the more likely one is to perceive that his or her intended outcomes are being met.H8: Habitual use of SNS will have a positive relationship with goal-congruent outcomes.As discussed earlier, the incentive-salience process causes significant changes in the mental processes of addicted users. Consequently, addicted users obsessively spend more time on SNS than is necessary (Shotton 1991, Yang and Tung 2007). Furthermore, addiction will steer users toward an ever-increasing desire for SNS use. But at some point, inflated cravings will become difficult to satisfy (Davis 2001). Given the increasing time addicts find themselves spending on SNS and their diminishing returns from this investment of time, we expect that the outcomes of their SNS use will be more negative than those of others. Taken together, if people become more obsessive about SNS use, we predict that their evaluations of the outcome of SNS use will compare unfavorably with their initial desired outcomes.H9: Addictive use of SNS will have a negative relationship with goal-congruent outcomes.3.6. Control VariablesThis study incorporates several control variables that may be pertinent in the context of online information services in general and social networking services in particular. First, the continued use of an information system should bring expected utility to users, which we captured as prior satisfaction with the system in question (Bhattacherjee 2001, Wixom and Todd 2005). However, addictive systems like SNS also amplify perceived intrinsic and extrinsic motivations (Davis et al. 1992, Turel et al. 2011b, van der Heijden 2004), and so we controlled for these two motivational factors. Beyond these generic motivations, the use of a SNS like Twitter will be specifically motivated by the need to achieve social ends, and so we specifically included social motivation as a potential factor. Finally, the continued use of an information system might simply be an extension of prior usage patterns (Limayem et al. 2007), which we captured in our model as experience and past use (Venkatesh et al. 2008). Apart from these major factors of continued systems use, we included demographic controls of gender and age that are known to often influence the use of information technology (Venkatesh et al. 2003).4. Method4.1. Data CollectionWe chose Twitter as the target application of this study.  Twitter—one of the most popular social networking websites in the world—allows its users to communicate text-based messages that are up to 140 characters in length (Lunden 2012).  People use Twitter for a variety of purposes that include, but are not limited to, keeping up-to-date with current affairs, socializing with others, and posting their own ideas and experiences. In this study, we used a nationwide online panel from a market research firm. At the outset, we conducted a pre-test to check the readability and accuracy of the survey questionnaire items. We contacted 57 Twitter users from the online panel and asked them to check the design and wording of the initial version of our Web-based survey. Based on the comments from these respondents, we revised the measurement items and refined the format of the questionnaire. To collect longitudinal data, we conducted two surveys separated by a month. In the first (Survey 1), we asked respondents to report their perceptions about using Twitter as well as other related personal characteristics. In the follow-up (Survey 2), we collected data on their actual use of Twitter and the consequences of this use.First, we performed Survey 1 by drawing a sample frame of adult members of Internet users between the ages of 18 and 65. In this survey, we included questionnaire items related to habit, addiction, and their antecedents and other controls. We randomly selected 8,000 U.S.-based members from the panel pool and sent them invitations with a link to our Web-based survey questionnaire. Initially, 3,627 members responded to the invitations; this represented a response rate of 45%. However, of the 3,627 members, only 569 were allowed to continue the survey because the others were not actual users of Twitter. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, approximately 15% of online adults use Twitter (Smith and Brenner 2012). Thus, the proportion of Twitter users in our study, i.e., 16% (569 out of 3,627), closely parallels that of general Internet users, i.e., 15%. However, because 17 responses were incomplete, we were left with a total of 552 complete responses in Survey 1. The average age of the respondents was about 36, and number of men and women on the panel was equal.One month later, we conducted Survey 2, which targeted the 552 respondents who had completed Survey 1. As with Survey 1, we sent each respondent an e-mail message that included a link to a Web-based survey. This questionnaire included measures capturing the consequences of habit and addiction such as goal-congruent usage and goal-congruent outcomes. In Survey 2, we collected 420 responses, yielding a relatively high response rate of 76%. The median age of these respondents was about 36, and 52% were men. No significant differences were found in age and gender distributions between nonrespondents (i.e., those who responded only to Survey 1) and Survey 2 respondents (i.e., those who responded to both Survey 1 and Survey 2). Thus, for subsequent analysis, we used the data collected from the 420 respondents who completed both surveys.4.2. MeasuresMost of our measurement items were adapted from existing scales in the literature.  However, we developed some new items where necessary. Appendix B contains the specific items included in this study.The main constructs of this study, i.e., habitual use and addictive use, were measured in Survey 1.  We measured habitual use using three items from global measure of habit (Kim et al.’s 2005; online Appendix A). These items are similar to other global scales of habit (Limayem and Hirt 2003, Mittal 1988) in that they reflect automaticity of behavior. However, we avoided items from previous habit scales that are reminiscent of impulsiveness measures (e.g., Polites and Karahanna 2012) that seem more closely related to addiction (Turel et al. 2011). Likewise, we measured addiction by adapting those items from Charlton’s (2002) global scale of addiction that reflect Griffiths’ (2000) and Peters et al.’s (2007) major core symptoms of interest. Our items are also similar in spirit to the measures of compulsiveness and obsessiveness found in other addiction scales (Turel et al. 2011). However, we avoided items that correspond conflict, which we captured in our goal-related outcomes in Survey 2.The four antecedents of habitual use and addictive use—i.e., routine seeking, cognitive rigidity, focused immersion, and concern for social acceptance—were also measured in Survey 1. Routine seeking was measured with two items borrowed from Polites and Karahanna (2012). Similarly, three items borrowed from Polites and Karahanna (2012) were used to measure cognitive rigidity. We used three items adapted from Agarwal and Karahanna (2000) to measure focused immersion. To measure concern for social acceptance, we used a three-item scale adapted from Leary et al. (2005).We also included in Survey 1 items to measure control variables such as extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation, social motivation, user satisfaction, past use, age, experience, and gender. We measured extrinsic motivation using three items modified from the scale of perceived information quality in Nicolaou and McKnight (2006). Intrinsic motivation was measured with three items modified from the scale of hedonic value in Kim et al. (2005). We created two new items to measure social motivation in the context of Twitter use. We measured user satisfaction by using three items adapted from Kim and Son (2009). To measure past use, we used two items that asked respondents the frequency of their Twitter use over the past month. Experience was measured by a single item asking respondents the number of years that they had used Twitter. We also measured age and gender at the end of Survey 1.In Survey 2, we measured the consequences of habitual use and addictive use, i.e., goal-congruent usage and goal-congruent outcome. To measure goal-congruent usage, we developed three items derived from the scale of plan enactment (Bagozzi et al. 2003). In developing this scale, we were careful to follow its conceptual definition, i.e., one’s perceptions of whether the amount of actual usage was within prior expectations. Likewise, to measure goal-congruent outcome, we used three items adapted from goal realization (Bagozzi et al. 2003). This scale was specifically designed to measure the perceived relevance of using Twitter.5. Data Analysis and Results5.1. Measurement ModelBefore testing our hypotheses, we used LISREL 8.80 to test the measurement model with a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of all measurement items and proposed constructs (Jöreskog and Sörbom 1996). The measurement model consisted of 13 reflective multi-item factors and 3 single-item factors for sex, age, and experience. Overall, the estimated measurement model demonstrated satisfactory model fit: χ2(585) = 1040.43 (p<0.001), CFI = 0.98, NNFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.045, SRMR = 0.043, GFI = 0.88, AGFI = 0.85. Table 1 shows means, standard deviations, composite reliabilities, and the average variance extracted for all 16 factors.We also examined the validity and reliability of our measures from the CFA of our measurement model. Our multi-item factors displayed adequate convergent validity by having item loadings higher than 0.60 (Bagozzi and Yi 1988). We verified discriminant validity in part by first making sure that interfactor correlations were smaller than the square root of their average variance extracted (Fornell and Larcker 1981). For added surety, we further examined the discriminant validity of construct pairs that had large correlations. We modeled each pair of factors using two alternative confirmatory measurement models: One allowed the pair to freely correlate; the other restricted the correlation to unity (Segars 1997, Zait and Bertea 2011). In each case, we found a significant chi-square difference between the alternatives, providing further evidence of discriminant validity. Apart from convergent and discriminant validity, we also checked the reliability of our factors by ensuring that they each had a composite reliability higher than 0.70 and an average variance extracted above 0.50 (Bagozzi and Yi 1988, Fornell and Larcker 1981). The adequate level of model fit and satisfactory criteria for validity and reliability suggested that our measurements were suitable for further use in a structural model to test our hypotheses.Table 1.

Proposed and Alternative ModelsWe extended our measurement with structural paths to create our three alternative structural models: first, a base model that considered only the effects of the control factors of prior motivation, usage, and experience on the outcomes of interest; second, our proposed model that extends the base model by adding antecedent factors and hypothesized paths (Figure 1); and third, a full model that extends the proposed model by allowing for all combinations of structural paths between antecedents and the mediating factors of habitual use and addictive use. Table 2 shows model fit indices and estimated structural parameters for the three alternative models.The base model contains the factors that are frequently associated with the use of information systems and that constitute the major control variables of our study as discussed earlier: satisfaction, intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, social motivation, past use, gender, and age. The base model allowed all of these controls to relate to habitual use, addictive use, and goal-oriented usage and outcomes. We found that the control variables had notable effects on certain factors. Past use and social motivation had strong effects on both habitual and addictive use. Age had small but nevertheless significant effects on habit and behavioral consequences. In contrast, extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation, social motivation, and satisfaction strongly influenced behavioral consequences. As seen in Table 2, the base model displayed fair goodness-of-fit with a RMSEA value below 0.08, but it could not meet the 0.05 threshold for close fit (Browne et al. 1993).We compared the parameter estimates of the proposed model with those of the base model to see if our hypothesized antecedents and structural paths improved the predictive validity of our endogenous factors or otherwise produced a noticeably better model. The proposed model included an additional four antecedent factors, namely, routine seeking, cognitive rigidity, focused immersion, and concern for social acceptance as well as the nine hypothesized structural paths. Most controlled effects remained fairly stable compared with their estimates in the base model. However, social motivation, which in the base model had a strong effect on goal-oriented usage and outcomes, no longer had these effects once habitual andTable 2.

The goodness-of-fit for the proposed model, shown in Table 2, indicates close fit across all indices – a marked improvement over the base model. Habitual use and addictive use had 42% and 68% of their respective variances explained, and goal-congruent use and goal-congruent outcome had 25% and 51% of their variance explained. Compared with the base model, the proposed model explained from 7.9% to 31.6% greater variance for the four endogenous constructs.Further comparison of the proposed model to the fuller model, within which it is nested, allowed us to gauge whether there was added value in theory-driven parsimony. Table 2 lists the parameter estimates and indices associated with the full model. The difference in model fit between the proposed and full models (Δχ2 = 5.79; Δdf = 4; p = ns) suggests that despite its added complexity, the full model does not fit the data significantly better than the proposed model. Furthermore, the full model’s variance explained for habitual use, addictive use, goal-congruent usage, and goal-congruent outcome were nearly identical to that of the proposed model. Thus, the proposed model gives a more parsimonious explanation of variance than the full model, while offering comparable model fit and predictive utility. Overall, we preferred the proposed model’s theory-based choice of antecedents and structural constraints. In contrast to the proposed model, the simpler base model seemed overly simplistic with worse fit, but a fuller model seemed overly complex with no added value.5.3. Tests of Research HypothesesThe estimated structural parameters of our proposed model allowed us to test the claims of our nine hypotheses. Figure 2 illustrates the results of the nine hypotheses. As shown in Figure 2, the estimated parameters strongly supported most of our hypotheses at the 5% significance level (p<0.05), but mostly at even smaller significance levels (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001). Hypotheses H1 through H4 called for positive relationships between two sets of antecedents and the two mediating factors, and these relationships were borne out in the results. Routine seeking was positively related to habitual use (0.15, p < 0.05) as stated in H1, and cognitive rigidity was positively related to habitual use as stated in H2 (0.21, p < 0.001). Similarly, we found that focused immersion was positively related to addictive use (0.15, p < 0.01) as proposed in H3,and concern for social acceptance was positively related to addictive use (0.25, p < 0.001), supporting H4. In addition, the mediating factor of habitual use was positively related to addictive use (0.19, p < 0.001), supporting H5.In examining the consequences of habitual and addictive use, the proposed model called for positive relationships between habitual use and the two goal-congruent consequences, but predicted negative relationships between addictive usage and the same set of consequences. We found that habitual use had a positive relationship with goal-congruent usage (0.27, p < 0.001), as stated in H6. In contrast, addictive usage had a negative relationship with goal-congruent usage (-0.21, p < 0.05), as predicted in H7.Habitual use had a positive relationship with goal-congruent outcome (0.26, p < 0.001), as stated in H8. The parameter estimate relating to our final hypothesis, H9, yielded an unexpected result: Addictive use was predicted to have a negative relationship with goal-congruent outcome, but instead it had a positive relationship with it (0.18, p < 0.05). Altogether, our research hypotheses were largely upheld, and the results paint an intricate picture in which automatic and addictive use have distinctive cognitive roots, influence each other, and have varied consequences for how users interact with information technologies.6. DiscussionThe objective of this study was to clarify the similarities and differences between habit and addiction in the context of SNS use. Drawing on the theories of automaticity and incentive-salience, we developed a theoretical framework that describes the nature, antecedents, and consequences of habitual use and addictive use. The proposed model was tested based on longitudinal data collected from 420 actual users of Twitter. The results of structural equation modeling provided strong support for our model and hypotheses. As expected, we found that habitual use had a positive impact on addictive use. In addition, our findings indicate that the antecedents of habitual use, i.e., routine seeking and cognitive rigidity, influenced only habitual use. In a similar vein, we found that the antecedents of addictive use, i.e., focused immersion and concern for social acceptance, influenced only addictive use. Moreover, this study shows that habitual use had a positive impact on goal-congruent usage, whereas addictive use had a negative impact on goal-congruent usage. In contrast, habitual use and addictive use were found to exert significant impacts on goal-congruent outcome in the same positive direction. Overall, the present study contributes significantly to the IS literature by offering a robust conceptual framework for understanding the two seemingly identical, yet profoundly distinct, drivers of SNS use.6.1. Theoretical ContributionsOveruse of the Internet has been cited as one of the most serious problems in the information age (Yellowlees and Marks 2007). In general, the causes of such overuse have often been attributed to habitual use (Huang et al. 2009) or addictive use (Chak and Leung 2004, Wang 2001, Young 1998). Although IS researchers have accumulated considerable knowledge about habitual use and addictive use, most studies paid attention to only one of these two forces and ignored the other. As a result, an integrative view of the interplay of habit and addiction in the context of IT use was lacking. In this sense, this study contributes significantly to the IS literature by systematically combining habitual use and addictive use into a unified theoretical framework. Drawing on theories from cognitive and neurocognitive sciences, our model posits that habit is goal-driven behavior, whereas addiction is driven by inflated desire. We found from our longitudinal investigation that the model represents SNS use in a substantially accurate way. Thus, further credence can be given to the validity of our theoretical framework. We believe that the new model will serve as a solid basis for further research on SNS use as well as on other nonwork-related use of online services.Prior research shows that routine seeking and cognitive rigidity help explain why people continue to use the same IT application over and over (Polites and Karahanna 2012). However, no studies have related such personality factors to the antecedents of habit in the IS field. Based on the theories of automaticity, the present study presents a theoretical account of how the formation of habit is influenced by one’s tendency to assess the outcome of prior IT use (Aarts and Dijksterhuis 2000, Kim et al. 2005, Verplanken et al. 1998). Some IS studies have identified the antecedents of habitual use, such as past use and satisfaction (Kim and Malhotra 2005, Limayem et al. 2007). Nevertheless, our study is the first to show that individual characteristics such as routine seeking and cognitive rigidity can influence the formation of habitual use. An even more interesting aspect of this study is that it shows routine seeking and cognitive rigidity have little impact on addictive use. These findings offer additional evidence that the formation of habit differs considerably from that of addiction in the context of SNS use. Thus, another contribution of this paper to the IS literature lies in its demonstration that habit and addiction are formed through fundamentally different mechanisms.	In one of the pioneering studies on additive use, Turel et al. (2011b) demonstrated that addiction affects such beliefs as perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived enjoyment. Our study expands the boundary of knowledge on addictive use by showing its antecedents. Rooted strongly in the addiction literature, this study identified two antecedents of addictive use, i.e., focused immersion and concern for social acceptance, that are related to the active pursuit of pleasure from SNS use and the fear of losing such pleasure (Kelley and Berridge 2002, Robinson and Berridge 1993, Robinson and Berridge 2003). This study is meaningful in that it provides valuable insights about the pre-addiction phase, which is characterized mainly by overestimation of the benefits (i.e., immersion) and costs (i.e., concern for social acceptance) of SNS use. Another notable point of this study is that although they are significant antecedents of addictive use, the psychological states represented by focused immersion and concern for social acceptance had little impact on habitual use. These findings further support the notion that habitual use is automatic behavior without the involvement of any conscious thought.Another notable feature of this study is its introduction of the goal-oriented perspective of IT usage, and more important, its demonstration of how habit and addiction differ in affecting this outcome factor. In IS research, the mere amount of IT use has been treated as an important dependent variable. Although helpful for understanding initial use and continued use, the simple notion of IT usage yields no insight into whether such usage is within the limit of an individual’s original plan in nonwork-related settings. This study contributes to the IS literature by conceptualizing and operationalizing a relatively new construct of goal-congruent usage. An important aspect of this new concept is that it clearly reveals the fundamental difference between habitual use and addictive use. Consistent with our hypotheses, the findings of this study suggest that habitual use positively affects goal-oriented usage, but addictive use negatively affects goal-oriented usage. These findings support our main claim that habit is goal-oriented, but addiction is not. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to show in a longitudinal context how habitual use and addictive use differently affect subsequent usage.	The results support all but one of our hypotheses. The lone exception related to the impacts of habit and addiction on goal-congruent outcome. Although the effect of habit on goal-congruent outcome was, as expected, positive, the effect of addiction on goal-congruent outcome was also found to be positive, which was the opposite of our prediction. We previously contended that addiction would make people visit a website to such a great extent that it would no longer benefit them. However, we found that addicted users still find their SNS use helpful in fulfilling their needs. Interestingly, in a cross-sectional context, Turel et al. (2011b) found that addiction is positively associated with perceived usefulness, which is similar to goal-congruent outcome. Turel et al. (2011b) explain this association by asserting that people distort their perceptions to positively color the outcome of their IT use. This explanation is not necessarily contradictory to our view that at an early stage of addiction people tend to inflate the benefits of IT use. However, our view also holds that with repeated use these people’s “liking” changes to a sort of “wanting,” and they eventually reach a point where they regret excessive use. Perhaps most respondents in our sample do not reflect severe cases of addiction. Consequently, they still view the outcome of addictive use favorably. In any case, this study is considered a significant addition to the discussion on SNS use because it reveals the multifaceted consequences of habitual use and addictive use. We hope that further research will clarify the complex consequences that are differently shaped by habitual use and addictive use.6.2. Practical ImplicationsOur study shows that a strong level of habitual use is relatively harmless or even could boost an individuals’ efficiency in handling everyday tasks. Thus, the public and media do not need to be overly concerned about habitual use of SNS. But our findings clearly indicate that addicted individuals use SNSs more than they want to. Unsurprisingly, such overuse is known to have negative ramifications on individual users, organizations, and society as a whole (Holden 2001, Hur 2006, Wang and Chu 2007, Young 2004). To provide healthy environments for SNS users, it is important that service providers quickly identify those individuals who are most likely to develop an addiction. How to identify SNS addiction-prone and addictive use is a significant issue. If practitioners simply consider hours and frequencies of SNS use to identify addiction-prone and addictive use, it is possible to confuse habitual use with addictive use. In such cases, practitioners may target inappropriate users for preventive measures. This research shows that SNS habitual and addictive use are based on two different processes (automatic versus incentive-sensitization). By paying heed to this distinction, practitioners can more accurately identify addiction-prone and addicted users. People who have strong tendencies for focused immersion and concern for social acceptance are inclined to addictive use. SNS providers should take steps to find how focused immersion and concern for social acceptance correlate to the unique interaction events of their service. For example, perhaps users who are prone to focused immersion might be identified by the intensity of interface interactions (scrolling, clicking). Similarly, those seeking social acceptance might be identified by semantic analysis of their postings, or by their preference of following certain other users. Once such correlates are identified, providers can routinely monitor usage patterns and preferences.Having identified potentially vulnerable users, SNS providers and mental health practitioners can design effective measures to prevent users from falling into addiction. For example, social motivation, which is one of the control variables in this study, is found to more strongly influence addiction than any other research and control variables (path estimate = 0.43, p < 0.01). These findings imply that SNS users whose primary motives are interpersonal interactions are more likely to become addicted than others who use SNS for information and enjoyment purposes. Thus, people with a high level of social motivation could be properly informed of the potential hazard related to excessive use, reminded of their usage levels, or simply encouraged to take a break during intense sessions of SNS use. Similarly, we have shown that addiction is strongly related with focused immersion and concern for social acceptance but not necessarily with routine seeking and cognitive rigidity. A short questionnaire in the course of the sign-up procedure or through an advertised incentive in the post-adoption stage would be a convenient way to measure these valuable pieces of diagnostic information. In this way, practitioners will be better able to discern potential risks associated with SNS use. The present study therefore helps practitioners detect early signs of addiction in SNS use and develop preemptive actions to reduce the pathological use of SNS.This research also suggests that caution should be applied to how extreme SNS addictive use is treated. As focused immersion, concern for social acceptance, and social motivation are strongly related to SNS addictive use, simply forcing users to decrease the hours and frequencies of SNS use is not an effective way to treat already addicted users. Once users are addicted to SNS use, it is not easy to break or replace their emotional and social dependency on SNS. Therefore, addictive users of SNS may need additional support such as a wide range of counseling services and support groups to release the concern for social acceptance and discharge the wanting feeling that arises from focused immersion and social motivation.6.3. Limitations and Further ResearchSeveral limitations of this study should be noted. First, it focused on only one context, i.e., individuals’ use of Twitter. Therefore, our findings cannot be generalized to other settings. Second, the model proposed in this study is not meant to be comprehensive; rather, it is mainly intended to contrast habit and addiction. Accordingly, our conceptual model may miss some variables relevant in the context of SNS use. Third, our data collection was performed using survey questionnaires, and thus, method biases such as common scale formats, common scale anchors, and social desirability could potentially confound out findings (Podsakoff et al. 2003). However, most survey-based studies have been shown to be relatively free of method biases (Kim et al. 2005, Turel et al. 2011b). Moreover, our study is longitudinal, which is believed to be more methodologically robust against method biases than cross-sectional studies. Although we expect minimal effect of method biases in this study, care should nevertheless be taken in interpreting our findings. Fourth, habit and addiction were operationalized as first-order factors in our study, but some other studies have treated them as second-order factors (Polites and Karahanna 2012, Turel et al. 2011b). Second-order factors were not used here because of the need to control the length of the survey. Thus, our model should be further validated through other forms of operationalization.Our study suggests fruitful avenues for further research. A new direction worth exploring would be how the roles of habit and addiction vary across different contexts. For example, in contexts such as online gaming, the effects of addiction on behavioral outcomes might be relatively stronger than found in the present study. Meanwhile, in settings such as online weather services, habit seems more likely to be a dominant factor. An interesting question here is how to analyze contextual characteristics that cause such changes in the roles of habit and addiction. If a classification scheme is created that organizes the contextual characteristics that affect the salience of habit and addiction (for example, behavioral opportunities), researchers will be able to anticipate the prevalence of habitual and addicted users in novel online services. Such a theory-based approach to contextual differences also is a key to the systematic accumulation of diverse findings in this emerging research area.Another interesting avenue for further research would be to investigate changes in habit and addiction over time. In the present study, we focused on clarifying the causes and effects of habit and addiction but paid little attention to how the inertia factors, i.e., habit and addiction, undergo transformation as individuals accumulate experience with online services. We will have a better understanding of the mechanism that is behind one’s inertia by scrutinizing how habit and addiction vary over time. In such a new study, the consequences of prior inertia factors could serve as the inputs to subsequent inertia factors in addition to the antecedents already identified in this study.  Moreover, through this type of panel study, the effects of the antecedents on the inertia factors would be evaluated more accurately. This improved accuracy would be because prior inertia factors can be taken into account as additional antecedents of subsequent inertia factors. The present study is longitudinal in nature, and it allows us to identify inertia factors, their antecedents, and consequences. Yet it does not offer a complete picture of the dynamics of habit and addiction in SNS use. We believe that a new panel study along this line will help clarify complex relationships that drive the change in the inertia factors over time.6.4. ConclusionsOnline social networking is one of the most popular Internet services, and its popularity is expected to continue. Although numerous users already spend a vast amount of time on SNS every day, we have had only limited knowledge of the hidden mechanisms underlying their continued use. Our study clearly demonstrates that both habit and addiction are the important drivers of continued use, but their nature, causes, and effects are fundamentally different. Moreover, this study presents a theoretical framework to better clarify the differences between habit and addiction in SNS use. We expect that habit and addiction play important roles in a variety of online contexts—for example, online games and online communities. It is our hope that more effort will be devoted to these important subjects of habit and addiction and that our model will serve as a useful tool for such endeavors.  ReferencesAppendix A: Summary of the Literature on Habit and AddictionTable A1.
